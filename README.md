# Arduino-Humidity-Detector
This would be my first Arduino Project which specializes in humidity level detection. 
The purpose of this project is to help anyone with plants who struggle watering them, and prevent wasting water. This detector can be used on larger scale projects, or as a precedent, to maintaining bigger natural areas. The Green LED lights up if the humidity level is favorable and the red one flashes when it's the opposite, letting you know the humidity results on the computer. 

Materials used: 

6 wires

2 LEDs (green and red)

1 Humidity Sensor 

The link below shows the finished breadboard and the second link the schematic design.
